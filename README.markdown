# Hex-to-UIColor Converter

Written in Python because why not?

## Installation
The most basic installation is simply cloning it
and copying it onto your path somewhere.

## Usage
It's a pretty stupid script. Simply run it and
paste in a hex color code and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
It should be in the format `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`.

If the hex code is valid, it will output a UIColor
literal such as
`UIColor(red: 130/255, green: 200/255, blue: 40/255, alpha: 1.0)`.


## Story
Why did I make such a dumb program? Pastebot.
I wanted to make a filter for Pastebot that would convert Hex codes
to UIColor, so I made this.
